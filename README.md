CareerForge Copilot

Think of it as a “Career GPS + Proof-of-Skills Engine” that doesn’t just polish resumes, but also guides, validates, and tracks your career growth.

🚀 Overview

CareerForge Copilot is an AI-powered platform designed to help students and professionals navigate their career journey. Unlike traditional resume optimizers, it provides proof-based validation, personalized growth paths, and real-time job readiness scoring.

This project was built as part of the Vartak Hackathon, focusing on bridging the gap between career aspirations and job-market demands.

✨ Core Features
1. Smart Resume Optimizer + Proof-Based Validation

Upload resume → AI tailors it for any job description.

ATS Score Predictor (% compatibility).

Rewrites bullets into STAR format with measurable impact.

Link every resume point to proofs (GitHub commits, Kaggle projects, certifications, demo videos).

2. Skill Gap Analyzer + Role Delta Engine

Paste a job link → AI compares required vs current skills.

Spider chart visualization of your skills vs role needs.

Ranks missing skills by impact and ease of learning.

Generates a 30-day personalized upskilling plan.

3. Personalized Growth Engine

Micro-learning paths (15-min daily tasks).

Micro-internship generator → mini-projects aligned with missing skills.

Certification roadmap → ROI-based recommendations.

4. Career Intelligence Dashboard

Tracks all applications, success rates, ATS improvements.

Recruiter Simulator → heatmap of what a recruiter notices in 6 seconds.

Interview Prep AI → generates likely questions.

Salary Negotiation Assistant → suggests salary ranges.

5. Gamified Career DNA Profile

Unique career fingerprint (hard + soft skills + aspirations).

Career XP system with badges for milestones.

Weekly career challenges based on job market trends.

6. Peer Learning & Job Market Integration

Anonymous mentorship → connect with peers who made similar moves.

🏆 Why CareerForge Stands Out

Goes beyond resume polish → adds recruiter simulator, proof-based resumes, micro-internships, and readiness scoring.

Shows real impact: ATS improvement, time saved, reduced skill gaps.

Hackathon-friendly MVP with a balance of innovation + feasibility.
